April Fool's Day, is not a holiday, but it is celebrated in many countries on April 1.
On April Fool's Day people play jokes on friends and neighbours.
At work you may be sent on a fools' errand, which can be embarrassing.
In some countries, April Fool's jokes (also called "April fools") must only be made before midday.
The April 1st tradition in France includes poisson d'avril (which means "April's fish" in English).
